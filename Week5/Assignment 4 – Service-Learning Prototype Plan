Community Food Pantry Inventory Tracker 
Prototype Goal
The goal of this prototype is to help a local community food pantry keep track of the items they have in stock. Many pantries use paper lists or guesswork, so this program makes it easier for volunteers to see what food is available, what has been donated, and what needs to be restocked.
This supports the Service-Learning purpose because it helps the pantry stay organized and serve the community better. By keeping an accurate inventory, the pantry can make sure families get what they need and avoid running out of important items.
